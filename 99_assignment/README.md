Assignment:
	Write 2 versions of 99 lines of code in two separate FUNCTIONS. The first version will run 99 lines of codes when the function is called. The second will take in user input and ask how many lines of codes should be in the file. Your code should then run that many lines of codes. (You should take into account that when you hit 1 line of code in the file the word line is NOT plural). If you find it easier to take in user input via an html document you are free to do so, but it is not required.

Example Output:

99 lines of code in the file, 99 lines of code; John strikes one out, clears it all out, 98 lines of code in the file, etc...
